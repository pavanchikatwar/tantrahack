# Vector-Borne Disease Outbreak Prediction

This project aims to predict the outbreak of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue using various parameters, including climate factors, population density, and historical health records.

## Features

- Predict outbreaks based on climate data (temperature, humidity, rainfall).
- Analyze population density effects on disease spread.
- Utilize historical health records for more accurate predictions.
- Visualization of data and predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
